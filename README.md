# Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site showcases my projects, skills, and experiences in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning.

## About Me

I'm Sarvesh Kharche, an MS in Data Science candidate at Rutgers University (May 2025) with experience as a TCS Analyst. I specialize in machine learning, NLP, and data analytics, with projects including LoRA-enhanced transformers and financial sentiment analysis. Proficient in Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face Transformers, I develop solutions that extract actionable insights from complex data. I'm seeking full-time roles in Data Science, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, or AI Engineering.

## Projects

### Automated Flashcard Generation Using LoRA-Enhanced Transformer Models
Developed an NLP-powered tool that automatically generates high-quality flashcards from academic notes using a fine-tuned T5 model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), improving study efficiency through contextual question-answer generation.
